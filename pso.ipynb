    "Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a optimization method developed in 1995. PSO works by having \"particles\" search a problem space for an objective function, attempting to find the minimum. These particles communicate with each other by affecting the velocity of particles with worse solutions. Therefore, each particle has its own personal best solution to an objective function, and the swarm itself has a personal best solution. Next, lets look at the pseudocode of the standard particle swarm optimization."

    "Before we look at the pseudocode, lets define a few things. An objective function represents the goal of an optimization or cost problem. A fitness function is a type of objective function that returns how close a current solution is to the desired solution. Our fitness and objective functions will be the same, as we only have a single objective of minimizing the objective function. We will define fitness as the value returned from plugging our particle's position into our fitness function. Now lets jump into the pseudocode."

Each particle is randomly given a position within the bounds of the objective function, and the particle's best known position is set to this position. Next the fitness of the particle's best known position is compared to the fitness of the swarm's best known position. If the particle's fitness is less than the swarm's, the swarm's fitness is updated with the particle's.
